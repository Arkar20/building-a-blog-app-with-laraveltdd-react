## About 

Brief – Reinvent the forum TDD with Laravel 8 and react including php unit tests. The propose is to learn in dept about Laravel by developing the real-world project.
 
lesson learnt – Learnt how to develop the project Test Driven Development (TDD). Learnt in-dept features of Laravel such as notifications, polymorphic relationships, job and queue, refactoring technique, and many more.  Additionally added job and queue feature which is not in the tutorial. Moreover, the frontend used built in context hook, a state management hook. 

Challenges - As the tutorial is developed with Laravel version 5. There is a small version conflict. But however, after doing my own research, I overcome this issue. Another issue is the tutorial is built with Vue js and as a react fan, this project uses React js. There is a difference when developing the client side.

uture plan – Develop API for mobile development (react-native).
